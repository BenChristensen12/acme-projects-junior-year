# acme-projects-junior-year
Projects I completed for the Junior year of ACME at BYU 2017-2018

The purpose of these repository is to showcase the projects I completed during my junior year of the ACME program (acme.byu.edu). 
Some of the projects were completed and run from a script. I converted these to jupyter notebook for easier viewing.
I also created example output for many of the functions in these projects so you can quickly see what the project should do.
But not all of the projects have that output.

Many of the projects were completed in jupyter notebook. These are the easiest to see the output. 
More of the algorithms_approximation_optimization projects were originally coded in jupyter notebook.

The projects are divided in two folders corresponding to the two ACME classes. 
The first is algorithms_approximation_optimization. This contains projects in graph theory, optimization, and approximation.
The second is mathematical_analysis. This contains applicatins of linear algebra including facial recognition and integral approximation.
The third is python_intro. These were the projects at the start of the program to prepare us for future projects.
